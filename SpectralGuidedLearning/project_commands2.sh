# ============================ TRAIN ============================
# per track: data -> capture (spectral + entropy) -> IWC weights/masks -> IWC SFT (DeepSpeed/HF path, 1 GPU).
# IWC and IWC-Stable share exactly the spectral-selected token set; only weights differ.
# Each script activates its own env (main env spectral_guided_learning for every step here),
# so start this driver with no venv active.
# qwen25-7b: data + capture + IWC masks already on disk from the earlier run -- retrain only if
# the new train_iwc_unsloth.sh hyperparameters (ga 32, lora r 16) should apply to this track too.

# IWC-Stable weights (Eq. 13-16), deliberately gentle: lambda 0.5 halves the tilt toward
# high-entropy steps, tau 2.0 flattens the softmax, clip 1.0 bounds any step to ~e^1 of the mean.
# Token mass is preserved per sample (weight_mass_ratio must print 1.000000), so the only thing
# that differs from the matched spectral arm (checkpoints/iwc-unsloth-qwen3-8b, r16/alpha16/ga32,
# whose weights were never applied -- see train_sft_unsloth.py) is the within-sample allocation.
