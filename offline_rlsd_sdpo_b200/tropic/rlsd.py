"""RLSD (RLVR with Self-Distillation) baseline - a line-for-line port of
Algorithm 1 / Eq. 13-17 from "Self-Distilled RLVR" (arXiv:2604.03128,
Yang, Qin, Si et al., JD.COM/IIE-CAS).

FIDELITY NOTES (read before touching this file):

  - The paper's Eq. 15/16 (the "final objective") apply a PPO-style min/clip
    to `w_t * A`, which would be an importance-sampling-ratio-style clip on
    top of the credit weight. Algorithm 1's own pseudocode (line 17, the
    thing they actually run) instead does:
        A_hat_t = A * ((1 - lambda) + lambda * clip(w_t, 1-eps_w, 1+eps_w))
    i.e. a LINEAR INTERPOLATION between the plain GRPO uniform advantage
    (weight 1) and the reweighted advantage (weight clip(w_t)), scaled by a
    decaying `lambda` - "to avoid an abrupt transition at the start of
    training... gradually shifting to the uniform advantage" as lambda decays
    to 0 (Sec 4.2). We implement Algorithm 1's formula (the code, not the
    prose min/clip in Eq 15-16), since the user directed code over prose
    where the two disagree, and Algorithm 1 is unambiguous pseudocode with an
    explicit textual justification, whereas Eq 16 has no such gloss.
  - RLSD's per-token weight w_t = (P_T(y_t)/P_S(y_t))^sign(A) is evaluated
    ONLY at the actually-sampled token y_t (Eq 13-14: log P_T(y_t), log
    P_S(y_t) are scalars, not full-vocab distributions) - unlike OPSD/
    TROPIC-P/SDPO, which all match/diverge full [T,V] distributions. This is
    the single biggest structural difference: RLSD needs no full-vocab
    machinery at all, only `ContextualPolicy`'s existing full log_softmax
    output gathered at one index per position.
  - Delta_t is stop-gradiented (`sg(...)`, Eq 13) and the resulting A_hat_t is
    then ALSO fully detached before being used as a REINFORCE coefficient
    (Theorem 5 (i): "directional isolation" - r never enters the gradient
    DIRECTION, only a scalar magnitude multiplying grad log pi_theta(y_t)).
  - The teacher's privileged context r in this codebase's implementation is
    the GOLD FINAL ANSWER ONLY (`tropic.data.build_rlsd_teacher_prefix`),
    matching the paper's own description ("RLSD requires only the final
    ground-truth answer without any reasoning trace") - the paper itself
    doesn't publish an exact prompt template (different domain/dataset), so
    that builder is our own, clearly-labeled construction.
  - The group-relative advantage (Eq 1) is literally GRPO's; nothing new to
    port there beyond mean/std over one rollout group for the same question.
  - **TEACHER-FRESHNESS CORRECTION** (found by reading the REAL reference
    implementation, github.com/iie-ycx/RLSD, after this file's first version
    assumed a fully-live teacher from the paper's prose alone): the repo's
    `verl/trainer/opsd_config.py` dataclass DEFAULT (`freeze_teacher_model=
    False`, `rlsd_teacher_sync_interval=0`) is indeed fully live ("shares
    actor weights and updates every micro-batch") - but the actual PUBLISHED
    launch script that produces their results, `examples/visual_rl/
    rlsd_train.sh`, explicitly overrides this to `opsd.freeze_teacher_model=
    True opsd.rlsd_teacher_sync_interval=20`. The real mechanism (verified in
    `verl/workers/actor/dp_opsd_actor.py`'s `_get_teacher_module`/
    `_sync_teacher_from_actor`, and the tail of `update_policy_grpo_opsd`:
    `if global_step > 0 and global_step % sync_interval == 0:
    self._sync_teacher_from_actor()`) is a SEPARATE teacher module, holding a
    snapshot of the actor's weights, refreshed every `sync_interval` steps
    and otherwise frozen (`.eval()`, no grad) in between - "a middle ground
    between fully frozen (stale signal) and fully shared (unstable /
    distribution drift)" per the config's own docstring. The teacher starts
    as a frozen copy of the INITIAL weights (matches this file's own
    `PeriodicTeacherSync`, which syncs once at construction). Everything
    else this file computes with that teacher's log-probs (`rlsd_token_
    weight`, `rlsd_token_advantage`) is verified to EXACTLY match the real
    `_build_stgca_advantages` (same file) line-for-line - only WHICH
    weights produced `log_teacher_tok` needed correcting, not the math done
    with it.
