"""OPSD-style dual-context data pipelines.

Two loaders are provided:
  - load_gsm8k_examples:      cheap, CPU-friendly, used by the Phase 0-8
                               smoke test on Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct.
  - load_opsd_math_examples:  the REAL training data OPSD itself trains on
                               (verified live against opsd_train.py:
                               `load_dataset("siyanzhao/Openthoughts_math_30k_opsd")`),
                               used for the GPU-scale TROPIC-vs-OPSD run on
                               Qwen3-1.7B.

In both cases: the student only ever sees the question. The teacher
additionally sees the reference solution as privileged context, following
OPSD ("the student sees only the problem, while the teacher additionally
sees the ground-truth solution").

The student/teacher prompt WORDING below is copied verbatim from OPSD's own
`data_collator.py` (`SelfDistillationDataCollator.__call__`, fetched live from
github.com/siyan-zhao/OPSD on 2026-09-02) rather than a paraphrase - a fair
comparison needs the two methods to see byte-identical prompts, and OPSD's
own reported numbers were produced with this exact wording.

Qwen3 is a "thinking" model: its chat template accepts `enable_thinking`
(True leaves `<think>...</think>` open for the model to fill in; False
pre-closes it with an empty block). OPSD's own defaults are
`teacher_thinking=True, student_thinking=False` (opsd_train.py
CustomScriptArguments) - the teacher reasons at length over the privileged
solution, the student is graded on its short-form answer. Qwen2.5 (used by
the earlier CPU smoke test) has no such template branch, so `enable_thinking`
is simply omitted there.

OLMo-3-7B-Think (allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Think) is a DIFFERENT case, verified live
against its real tokenizer on 2026-09-15: unlike Qwen3, its chat template
has NO `enable_thinking` branch at all - passing `enable_thinking=False` is
silently ignored (confirmed: rendered text is byte-identical with or
without it). Its template's OWN `add_generation_prompt=True` output already
ends with an OPENED `<think>` tag (not closed), so the model always starts
reasoning. To get a non-thinking rollout anyway, this file uses the
community "empty think prefill" trick already documented for DeepSeek-R1-
style reasoning models (see e.g. huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-
Distill-Qwen-14B/discussions/11): manually append a closing `</think>` (with
blank content) right after the template's own auto-opened `<think>`, so the
model sees an ALREADY-CLOSED, empty reasoning block and proceeds straight to
the final answer instead of generating one. This is `empty_think_suffix`
below - UNVERIFIED end-to-end (confirmed only that the template ignores
`enable_thinking` and ends on an open `<think>`; NOT confirmed that OLMo-3-
7B-Think actually skips reasoning after seeing the closed empty block the
way DeepSeek-R1 does - that pattern is well-documented for DeepSeek-R1 but
OLMo-3-Think is a different model/training recipe). Test on a real
checkpoint (inspect a few actual generations) before trusting this for a
real training run - see CONFIG's own comment in whichever script sets
`empty_think_suffix` for OLMo.
