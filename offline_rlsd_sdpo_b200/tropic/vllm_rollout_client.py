"""vLLM-accelerated rollout generation for training (data-parallel, server
mode) - replaces `tropic.rollout.generate_rollout`'s sequential HF
`model.generate()` calls (the actual bottleneck making training ~25-26 min/
step, ~42h for 100 steps) with N independent `vllm serve` processes, one per
free GPU, each handling a slice of the per-step rollout batch in parallel.

FIDELITY NOTE (see the approved plan, C:\\Users\\LENOVO\\.claude\\plans\\
you-are-a-senior-idempotent-pizza.md): OPSD's REAL colocate mode (verified
live against opsd_trainer.py, github.com/siyan-zhao/OPSD) syncs weights via
`model.merge_adapter()` + vLLM's INTERNAL `engine.model_executor.driver_
worker.model_runner.model.load_weights(...)`, in the SAME process/GPU as
training (~60% extra VRAM per their own launch script,
`--vllm_gpu_memory_utilization 0.6`). That was deliberately NOT replicated
here (real OOM risk on the 40GB GPUs this project already uses, which have
OOM'd on eval alone this session) - instead: vLLM runs as a fully separate
process on a SEPARATE GPU, and weight sync goes through vLLM's own PUBLIC
runtime LoRA-reload HTTP API instead of its private engine internals.

Verified live against the ACTUAL vLLM version installed on the training
cluster (v0.8.3, `pip show vllm` on dionysos) by fetching vllm/entrypoints/
openai/api_server.py + serving_models.py + protocol.py at tag v0.8.3 from
github.com/vllm-project/vllm - not assumed from memory:
  - `POST /v1/load_lora_adapter` {"lora_name": str, "lora_path": str} and
    `POST /v1/unload_lora_adapter` {"lora_name": str} are real, PUBLIC
    endpoints, but only registered when the server is launched with env var
    `VLLM_ALLOW_RUNTIME_LORA_UPDATING=1` (vLLM's own gate - logs a "local
    development only" warning, which is fine for this controlled research
    cluster use).
  - Loading a `lora_name` that's ALREADY loaded is REJECTED with HTTP 400
    ("has already been loaded") - `serving_models.py`'s own validation.
    There is no "just overwrite" call - every refresh must unload-then-load
    the SAME name. The very first refresh has nothing to unload yet, so a
    400 from THAT unload call is expected and swallowed (not from the load
    call - a 400 there is a real error).
  - `POST /v1/completions`'s `prompt` field accepts `list[list[int]]`
    (`protocol.py`'s `CompletionRequest.prompt` type) - a whole shard's
    token-id prompts can be sent as ONE batched request per replica, vLLM's
    own continuous batching handles the parallelism server-side.

KNOWN IMPRECISION (documented, not silently swallowed): `/v1/completions`
returns each completion as DECODED TEXT (`choices[i].text`), not raw token
ids - `generate_rollout_batch_parallel` re-tokenizes that text with the SAME
tokenizer (`add_special_tokens=False`) to recover `generated_ids`/`gen_len`
in the shape the rest of the training loop expects (matching `tropic.
rollout.generate_rollout`'s return contract). Re-tokenizing decoded text does
not ALWAYS reproduce the exact original token sequence at BPE merge
boundaries - a known, generally-accepted imprecision when bridging an
HTTP text-completions API back into token-level training (this is not
unique to this project; every framework that drives vLLM's OpenAI-compatible
server for rollouts faces the same trade-off). Not resolved here because
vLLM's public completions API has no raw-token-id response mode as of
v0.8.3 - flagged for whoever runs this, not hidden.

    (data-parallel replicas, NOT tensor-parallel - the model is 1.7B/4B,
    already fits on one 40GB GPU, so splitting ONE model across GPUs would
    only add cross-GPU communication overhead for no benefit; independent
    replicas instead each handle a slice of the per-step rollout batch).
    Blocks until every replica's `/health` endpoint responds. Caller is
    responsible for terminating the returned processes when done (e.g. in a
    `finally` block) - these are NOT daemonized/auto-cleaned-up.

    `log_dir` (defaults to the CURRENT working directory if not given):
    each replica's stdout+stderr is written to `<log_dir>/vllm_replica_
    gpu<id>.log` - NEVER swallowed to DEVNULL, so a startup crash (wrong CLI
    flag, port already in use, OOM, etc.) is diagnosable instead of showing
    up only as a silent, zero-GPU-memory `<defunct>` process.

    `vllm_executable` (default "vllm", resolved via inherited PATH): pass an
    ABSOLUTE PATH when the TRAINING process runs in a different conda env
    than the one vLLM is actually installed/working in - e.g. this project's
    real setup has vLLM 0.8.3 needing torch==2.6.0's DEFAULT PyPI CUDA-12.4
    wheel (bundled nvidia-cuda-*-cu12==12.4.127 packages), which conflicted
    (undefined symbol in vllm's precompiled _C.abi3.so) with the training
    env's own torch build - so vLLM lives in a SEPARATE env
    (`tropic-vllm`) and must be invoked via its full path, e.g.
    '/research/.../miniconda3/envs/tropic-vllm/bin/vllm', NOT just "vllm"
    (which would resolve to the training env's own, possibly broken, vllm
    on PATH).

    `gpu_memory_utilization` (default None): when given, passed through as
    `--gpu-memory-utilization <value>` to every replica - otherwise vLLM's
    own default (0.9) applies unchanged. Useful on GPUs with much more VRAM
    headroom than this project's original 40GB A100s (e.g. a B200) to widen
    the KV-cache pool and admit more concurrent requests, which matters more
    under an unrestricted (top_k=-1) sampling recipe where a handful of
    generations can run to the full max_new_tokens."""
